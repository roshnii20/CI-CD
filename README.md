# CI-CD
Implementing an end to end Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline using AWS pipeline services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and CodePipeline

Let us first understand what is a CI/CD Pipeline:

Stages in a Pipeline:

Continuous Integration (CI):

Continuous Integration is the step where all the developers work together on codes in a repository, make changes several times a day. With help of automated build, each commit is verified to detect problems/errors early on.

The difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment (CD) :

Continuous Delivery(CD) is a process where the software release process is almost automated but still needs a manual approval before releasing it whereas Continuous Deployment eliminates all the manual steps including the approval so anyone with adequate priveleges can directly release the software. 


Here in this exercise, we will implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS.

We will need following two things to implement our Pipeline:
• AWS Account
• Virtual Machine

PART 1: CodeCommit
